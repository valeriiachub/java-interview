`TreeMap` is an example of a `SortedMap`. Tree structure, based on compareTo() implementation, O(log(N)) runtime complexity for 
inserting and searching, sorted.

`HashMap`lookup-array structure, based on hashCode(), equals() implementations, O(1) runtime complexity for inserting and searching, 
unsorted.

You should choose `TreeMap` when you need to extract submaps with an upper or lower bound on the key, find the minimum or maximum keys, 
or find keys closest to a given key. Or when you want to sort the map according to some `Comparator` definition.
